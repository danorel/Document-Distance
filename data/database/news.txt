Donald Trump's former election campaign chief Paul Manafort breached his plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller by lying to prosecutors, a US judge says.
US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Manafort "made multiple false statements" to the FBI, Mr Mueller's office and a grand jury.
Mr Mueller leads a probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 US election.
Manafort was convicted of financial fraud in August.
This related to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine.
Manafort, 69, then accepted a plea deal on other charges in return for co-operating with Mr Mueller's investigation.
